ThrottleBot:

The advent of accessible open source software and lightweight virtualized containers have led to the widespread adoption of complex software services like Spark or Redis. In spite of the popularity of these services, performance tuning for these services are usually managed by provisioning large teams of manual labor for the problem. The manpower required for this makes it highly unfeasible for the vast majority of organizations. We propose ThrottleBot which identifies performance bottlenecks for a containerized service by systematically throttling the container resources. Ultimately, this makes it possible to intelligently provision containers while allowing the user to treat the system as a black box. ThrottleBot successfully identifies the bottleneck in a variety of widely used services, including Nginx, Spark, and the MEAN stack.ThrottleBot!
