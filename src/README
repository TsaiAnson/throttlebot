Instructions on how to use ThrottleBot:

1. Run stress_scheduler.py with python2.7 with the proper arguments.
The mandatory arguments and options needed for Throttlebot to run correctly are the website_ip, victim_machine_public_ip, experiement_type, services to stress, resources to stress, and stressing policy. If there are multiple website_ips, victim_ips, services, and resources, separate them with a single comma ','. The optional arguments will vary depending on your experiment type and preference. For example, if I wanted to run an experiment to benchmark the performance of all todo-app services under all levels of stress to all resources, I could run:

python2.7 stress_scheduler.py WEBSITE1,WEBSITE2,WEBSITE3 VICTIM1,VICTIM2,VICTIM3 todo-app --traffic_generator_public_ip=GENERATOR1 --stress_all_services --stress_all_resources --stress_search_policy='ALL'

	where WEBSITE, VICTIM, and GENERATOR are the IPs for the websites, victim machines, and the traffic generator respectively.

Refer to the help section for more information.

2. If necessary, set the "password" variables for your SSH keys. Without this, Throttlebot cannot execute commands on the virtual machines. They are located within remote_execution.py and measure_performance_MEAN_py3.py.
